# Todo List Application

## Overview

This is a simple command-line Todo List application written in Go. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, listing, and deleting tasks. The application runs in a loop, accepting user commands until the user decides to exit.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can add a new task to the list.
- **List Tasks**: Users can view all the tasks currently in the list.
- **Delete Task**: Users can delete a task by specifying its index.
- **Exit**: Users can exit the application.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download and install Go from the official website: [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).

1. Clone the repository or create a new Go file and copy the code into it.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is located.

## Usage

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the application using the command:

   ```bash
   go run <filename>.go
   ```

   Replace `<filename>` with the name of your Go file.

3. You will see a welcome message and a prompt (`$ `) to enter commands.

### Commands

- **Add Task**: To add a task, type `add <task description>`. For example:
  
  ```
  add Buy groceries
  ```

- **List Tasks**: To list all tasks, type `list`. The application will display all tasks with their corresponding indices.

- **Delete Task**: To delete a task, type `delete <index>`, where `<index>` is the index of the task you want to remove. For example:
  
  ```
  delete 0
  ```

- **Exit**: To exit the application, type `exit`.

### Example Interaction

```

1. Clean the house
$ delete 0

```

## Notes

- The application is case-sensitive for commands. Use `list` instead of `List`.
- Ensure that the index provided for deletion is valid; otherwise, an error message will be displayed.
- The application currently does not persist data between sessions. All tasks will be lost when the application is closed.
